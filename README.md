# Shadow Orography Studio

Desktop application and computational engine for yearly worst-case wind turbine shadow intersection analysis on polygon AOI.

## Troubleshooting executable startup on Windows

If `ShadowOrography.exe` closes immediately (even from console), check the startup log generated by the app:

- Log file path: `%TEMP%\\shadow_orography_startup.log`
- Example full path: `C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\shadow_orography_startup.log`

The file records unhandled exceptions during app bootstrap so you can identify missing dependencies/plugins.

## Git pull error: "untracked working tree files would be overwritten by merge"

If `git pull` fails with messages like:

- `pyproject.toml`
- `src/shadow_orography/main.py`

run these commands from the repo root to inspect and clean only untracked files that block merge:

```bash
git status --short
git clean -n
```

If the listed files are disposable local copies, remove only those files and pull again:

```bash
rm pyproject.toml src/shadow_orography/main.py
git pull
```

If you want to keep a backup first:

```bash
mkdir -p ../shadow_orography_backup
cp pyproject.toml src/shadow_orography/main.py ../shadow_orography_backup/
rm pyproject.toml src/shadow_orography/main.py
git pull
```

If there are many local untracked files to preserve, stash including untracked and re-apply after pulling:

```bash
git stash push --include-untracked -m "backup before pull"
git pull
git stash pop
```
