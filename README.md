# Shadow Orography Studio

Desktop application and computational engine for yearly worst-case wind turbine shadow intersection analysis on polygon AOI.

## Troubleshooting executable startup on Windows

If `ShadowOrography.exe` closes immediately (even from console), check the startup log generated by the app:

- Log file path: `%TEMP%\\shadow_orography_startup.log`
- Example full path: `C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\shadow_orography_startup.log`

The file records unhandled exceptions during app bootstrap so you can identify missing dependencies/plugins.
