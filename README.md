# Shadow Orography Studio

Desktop application and computational engine for yearly worst-case wind turbine shadow intersection analysis on polygon AOI.

## Troubleshooting executable startup on Windows

If `ShadowOrography.exe` closes immediately (also when launched from `cmd`/PowerShell), use this workflow:

1. Run the executable from terminal to capture stderr:
   - `ShadowOrography.exe`
2. Open the startup log generated by the app:
   - Default path: `%TEMP%\shadow_orography_startup.log`
   - Example: `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Temp\shadow_orography_startup.log`
3. Look for `Fatal startup error` and the Python traceback.

### Typical causes and fixes

- **Missing Visual C++ runtime**: install/repair "Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2015-2022" (x64).
- **Qt plugin not found (`platforms/qwindows`)**: verify packaging includes `PySide6/plugins/platforms`.
- **Blocked by antivirus/SmartScreen**: whitelist executable and app folder, then retry.
- **Corrupted config/project path**: start without loading project and re-open a valid JSON/shapefile.

### Extra debug option

You can override the startup log path (useful in CI or support scripts):

- `set SHADOW_OROGRAPHY_STARTUP_LOG=C:\temp\shadow_debug.log`
- then launch `ShadowOrography.exe`

The log records bootstrap failures early, including import/plugin errors before the UI appears.
